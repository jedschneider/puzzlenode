# Steganography 101

My solution to the puzzler at ["Puzzle Node"](http://puzzlenode.com/puzzles/12/)

## running the code

    ruby sten.rb
    
also there is a little hash diff function to allow you to check for diffs in files

    ruby diff.rb output.bmp sample_output.bmp
    
## running specs

specs need rspec 2

    rspec spec
    
## Discussion

I've never twiddled bits before. It was defiantly a learning process. I had a lot to pick up with finding offsets, to bitwise operators. Fun, but more intense than I expected.
